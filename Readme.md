## Element Selector

    style applied on elements by directyly using the tag name ex
    paragraph <p>, body <body>, header <header>, footer <footer> , <h1>, <h6> etc  .

    we can style them by justing using there name like this
    p{
        property-name : value;
    }
    h1{
        property-name: value ;
    }

## Class Selector

    class selector is used to group the element tag to apply common style
    for that in element tag we have to write class="name".
    and to style that element using that class name we can use dot ( . )
    ex :
    .name{
        property-name : value;
    }

    note : class is used to group element together to apply common style , so one class can be applied to many .

## ID Selector

    Id selector is used to set uniquness for an element . and can be write on element as id="unique-name"
    to style id based element we can use # (hash)
    ex

        property-name : value;
    }
